A basic implementation of in app use of the camera as per the instructions at http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/camera.html

Additional notes:

-The phone needs to be rebooted in order for the images to show in the gallery area.
-The phone uses the FLAG_KEEP_SCREEN_ON tag to prevent the phone from falling asleep while taking photos. As such leaving the app on will drain the battery. One should turn off the app as soon as it is no longer needed.
